## Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)

### Dataset

We will focus on two datasets for our main visualization - [*Migration
Flow dataset*](https://guyabel.com/publication/global-migration-estimates-by-gender/) 
by Professor Guy Abel from the School of Sociology and
Political Science at Shanghai University and the United Nations'
[*Migration Stock dataset*](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/migration/data/index.asp). 
This will give a global overview of migration
with some possible filtering, e.g. by sex and age. In addition, we will
explore the feasibility of adding a more specific visualization of data
based on a focus country or focus group of migrants (e.g. refugees and
asylum-seekers).

### Problematic

Debates on migration often appear in the news. They usually focus on a
singular event or group of people and try to elicit emotional reactions
from the reader. It is therefore hard to have an objective idea of the
scale of the global phenomenon outside of this particular instance. Our
visualization proposes to offer this insight: you can see what is the migration
flow from any country to any other averaged over 5 years. So the next
time someone claims that there are too many immigrants from this
particular country to that particular one, you have a mean to approve or
disprove the claim. Besides, you can have an overview of what are the
countries that have the highest (and lowest) numbers of immigrants
overall and with respect to their total populations.\
A recent such example is the European refugee crisis. Our attention was
focused on this particular group of people migrating in the European
Union from across the Mediterranean Sea or through Southeast Europe.
While the media often presented this as a local one-off occurrence, the
reality is way more constant and widespread. While this is a more
specific example, it still is a big part of global migration.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Pre-processing of the data set you chose:

1.  Show some basic statistics and get insights about the data

### Related work

Professor Guy Abel from the School of Sociology and Political
Science at Shanghai University, has made very significant work on
studying global migration as well as visualizing it. The two
following papers from him are based on the datasets that we will
use.
